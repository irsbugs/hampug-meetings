2. Introduction
3. Yesterday I did a talk on using Python to scrape all the song lyrics from a particular artist (from lyricsfreak.com) and then create a word cloud from all those lyrics using either using Wordle or using R's wordcloud package. The idea was to get a visual representation of the words that were said the most by a particular band or artist.
4. The two main methods for doing this were through geturl() and getbetween(). geturl() is self-explanatory, and getbetween() allows us to find all strings that are in between two strings, for a particular body of text. So we use this method to basically wrangle data out of the HTML. As I mentioned in the talk, this way of doing things is kind of crude - it's good for quick one-offs or if you don't care about anything apart from getting the data. But there are nicer ways of doing this, such as using BeautifulSoup where you can navigate the DOM of the HTML. Hell, I should probably use that more often too!
5. As mentioned at the start, we used both Wordle and R to generate our wordclouds. Wordle makes nicer wordclouds but it may be less accessible from a programmatic standpoint. R makes reasonably good looking wordclouds but it involves a lot of fiddling with parameters!
6. Usage
7. python get.py > output/out.txt

8. Note that there is a boolean flag in the script called ONLINE - if it's set to true, then it will download the .html files (that correspond to lyrics from each song) and save them to a folder called saved in the same directory as the script. Otherwise if the boolean is set to false it will assume you already have the .html files in that folder and then do everything locally. I have also made other improvements to the script since the presentation, such as having the script create the output directory for you if it doesn't exist, etc.
9. Then you can copy and paste the contents of out.txt into Wordle or use the R script create-cloud.R (if you know R!).
10. Useful links
11. 
PDF printer for extracting Wordle clouds (Ubuntu)
BeautifulSoup

5. Update Note as of 2019:
6. venv — Creation of virtual environments became new in version 3.3 (September 2012).
The venv module provides support for creating lightweight “virtual environments” with their own
site directories, optionally isolated from system site directories.
7. The pyvenv script has been deprecated as of Python 3.6 (December 2016) in favor of using
python3 -m venv to help prevent any potential confusion as to which Python interpreter
a virtual environment will be based on.
8. Deprecated since version 3.6: pyvenv was the recommended tool for creating virtual
environments for Python 3.3 and 3.4, and is deprecated in Python 3.6.
9. See: https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html

Chris Beckham: Gooey (https://github.com/chriskiehl/Gooey) is a fairly recent project written in Python that allows one to convert easily console applications to GUI ones with just one extra line of code. This gives command-line loving developers (i.e. Unix philosophers) a way to cater their programs to those that are more comfortable with GUIs without having to do a bunch more work.

2. Demostration of two python programs
3. Ian Stewart demonstrated two of his python programs. The programs are the
files loadscript.py and cadence_hampug_demo.py.
4. loadscript.py
5. loadscript.py is designed to load a python script file or bash script file
from a current development folder and place it into /usr/local/bin/ folder.
The files name will be truncated. For example, myprog_v3.py will become
myprog.
6. The permissions on the file copied to /usr/local/bin are modified, and the file
is checked to ensure it has a shebang in the first line. E.g.
7. #!/usr/bin/env python3
8. The script may now be executed at the command line by just typing the file name
and providing any input options or arguments the program requires. E.g.
9. $ myprog -i test.txt
10. Please see the
11. $ loadscript --documentation

12. and the
13. $ loadscript --help 

14. for more details.
15. cadence_hampug_demo.py
16. cadence is a command line program to model a bikes pedalling cadence to its
speed depending on what gears are used.
17. cadence features the generic function query() to solicit input from the User.
The query() function ensures the User types on the keyboard a response that is
acceptable to the desired data type of either string, boolean, integer or
floating point.

2. RPi.GPIO
3. Ian Stewart presented the RPi.GPIO python module.
4. The Raspberry Pi computer has a connector to provide physical access to connect
LED's and switches, etc., to the General Purpose Input and Output (GPIO)
signals. The python module RPi.GPIO allows a selection of pins on this
connector to be configured to receive input, or generate output signals.
RPi.GPIO also supports providing a Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) output signal.
5. The Raspian distro provides a Debian based GUI desktop environment for the
Raspberry Pi. Included in Raspian are Python 2 & 3, the tkinter/ttk GUI tool
kit, and the Integrated Development Environment IDLE. Raspian also includes the
python module RPi.GPIO.
6. As well as the slide show presentation material, there are 9 demonstration
programs to highlight features of the RPi.GPIO module. Most of these programs
utilize the tkinter GUI and use the themed tool kit (ttk). A brief summary of
these programs is as follows:
7. 
01_demo_get_pin.py – Display P1 Connector pins.
02_demo_rpi_package.py – Display information on the python Rpi.GPIO package.
03_demo_ttk_1_led.py – Using the tkinter GUI, turn on and off a LED.
04_demo_ttk_4_led_counter_simple.py – 4 x LED's counting in binary from 0 to 15.
05_demo_ttk_4_led_counter_complex.py - 4 x LED's counting in binary. Uses [::-1]
06_demo_ttk_4_led_counter_inc_dec.py – Use tkinker GUI to increment/decrement counter.
07_demo_ttk_2_switches.py – Receive input from two switches. NB: Run as sudo.
08_demo_ttk_pwm_linear.py – Pulse Width Modulation with a linear frequency scale.

12. Presentation Notes
13. IPython is an interactive shell, originally for Python. Though it is now being generalized, via the Jupyter project, to handle other languages on an equal basis.
14. IPython interfaces to the language implementation via its own “kernel” process. Separate from the kernel is the front end, of which there are three: one based on a character terminal, one built with the Qt GUI toolkit, and the web-based notebook interface. Of the three, the notebook interface is the most powerful, it’s the only one I have much experience with, and it is the one I will talk about here. If you’ve used Mathematica, the notebook concept will be very familiar.
15. The kernel process maintains a context for script programs that is preserved for as long as the kernel remains running. Thus, you can feed a command to define a variable or open a file, and then later send another command to access that variable or do something with that file. When the kernel is terminated, all such context is lost.
16. The notebook server is a custom web server, so the user interface can be provided via any modern web browser. A notebook file (extension “.ipynb”) is actually a text file in JSON format. Its content is a sequence of cells. Each cell can contain program-language text (in Python, in this case) to be executed by the kernel, or text that is only to be read by the user of the notebook, which can be nicely formatted using Markdown markup. The latter text can also include mathematical formulas in the appropriate subset of LATEX markup, implemented by the MathJax library, which is written in JavaScript and does all its actual rendering in the web browser.
17. Program cells can generate text or graphical output, which is displayed immediately following the cell when it is executed. They can also generate Markdown or mathematical markup by using the appropriate API calls, allowing the convenient display of dynamically-generated formatted text or mathematical formulas as well as more general graphics.
18. Not only that, but program code can also define simple interactive “widgets” (e.g. sliders, text-input fields) to create a very basic custom GUI that allows the user to interact with the cell output.
19. The notebook file saves the original cell content, along with the formatted representation of non-program cells. Remember that the in-memory program context (variables, open files etc) lives only in the kernel process, not the notebook front-end.
20. There is no command that simply saves the current notebook under its current name. There is a “Save and Checkpoint” command, which saves the notebook and also makes a time-stamped “checkpoint” copy in the “.ipynb_checkpoints” subdirectory. Also the notebooks is periodically autosaved, at an interval that defaults to 2 minutes. Alternatively, you can simply close the notebook window/tab; if there are unsaved changes, you get prompted whether you really want to leave the page. Regardless of what you select here, the notebook will be saved.
21. What about security? First of all, a notebook can execute arbitrary code. The notebook server, and the kernel, make no attempt to constrain the kinds of programs that can be executed. The assumption is that these are running on machines under the user’s control, executing code specified by the user. Therefore it is not their job to limit what the user can do.
22. There is another issue, that of receiving a notebook from another (possibly untrusted) source and executing arbitrary code from that. IPython doesn’t prevent you from doing this. But it will not automatically execute JavaScript from cached cell output, unless the notebook signature is verified against a key known to the user https://ipython.org/ipython-doc/3/notebook/security.html. Normally each user generates their own key, but it is possible to share keys with trusted colleagues.
23. IPython lets you set up multiple profiles, and easily switch between them. These let you create different sets of custom default settings for different usages. Profiles can also be used to isolate trust between different groups that you work with.

Peter Reutemann will show how to serve a Django application (https://www.djangoproject.com/) through the pure-Python WSGI server waitress (https://github.com/Pylons/waitress).
waitress is an interesting and light-weight alternative to other WSGI capable servers like Apache/mod_wsgi, especially if you are only serving a single Python application.

2. Web-Scraping
3. Lawrence D’Oliveiro
4. Lawrnce demonstrated a simple web-scraping task, namely automating the downloading of files from a 3D model archive site, using Python with the BeautifulSoup HTML-analysis library. This could be a useful introduction to those new to the concept of web-scraping.
5. The files for this presentation are in the folder /ldo-web-scraping/

8. Intel Basic Speed Comparisons
9. Peter Reutemann
10. Intel claims that their custom Python distribution (https://software.seek.intel.com/python-distribution) delivers "close-to-native-code performance". Peter ran some basic speed comparisons to see whether it lives up to that claim.
11. Refer to the files in the folder /intel_distro/
12. Introduce Data Manipulation Using List Methods
13. Ian Stewart
14. The list() function to convert a string to an array of characters is complemented by a string's join() method. The list methods include append() and pop(0) which allow a list to be used as a fifo buffer. Ian gave a brief Jupyter Notebook presentation to introduce data manipulation using list methods.

2. Presentation on Creating a Website
3. A static web-site, hosted on PythonAnywhere, with web-pages created using reStructuredText and the website generated by the Nikola application.
4. Presenter: Ian Stewart
5. The presention at the meeting held on 13 May 2019 covered the following:
6. 
Obtaining a reStructuredText (reST) editor.
Using the editor to create reST web-pages.
Creating a python virtual environment
Installing Nikola static website generator application in the virtual environment.
Using Nikola to convert the reST web-pages into html files and generate the website.
Creating a free beginners account on PythonAnywhere
Uploading the web-site to the PythonAnywhere account.

7. In a somewhat recursive scenario, the presentation that Ian delivered is captured  in a website that he created. Please review the website http://hampug1.pythonanywhere.com
8. As part of the presentation Ian performed many linux bash commands to create the basic template for the web-site he built. These commands are attached as the file presentation_history.  You can replace your ~/.bash_history file with this presentation_history file. By recalling your bash history in sequence with the bash history commands, !1, !2, !3, etc., you may repeat the delivery in the presentation and create your own template web-site. You may then modify the template to build your own web-site. As part of the presentation a modified Nikola conf.py file is used called conf_quiet.py. Please find this file in this repository and place it in your home folder. The conf_quiet.py file is the conf.py file with edits in four places. Search with the string Edited by Ian to see what the editing involved.
9. Attached are the files:
10. 
presentation_history
conf_quiet.py

11. The presentation_history file is installed on your linux laptop computer as follows:
12. 

Place the presentation_history file into your home folder. I.e. Your ~/ folder.


Open one console terminal window on your laptop.


Check that you have .bash_history file.  $ ls -l .bash_history


Make a backup: $ cp .bash_history bash_history_backup_$(date '+%Y%m%d-%H%M%S')


Overwrite the bash_history: $ cp presentation_history .bash_history


Clear history currently in memory:  $ history -c


Close the console terminal window.


Open a console terminal window.  The history for this terminal will now contain the bash commands to learn about Nikola and create a template web-site. Execute the commands sequencially using the history recall as follows: $ !1 then $ !2  then $ !3 etc.
